# zcoreutils

This is an (unfinished) attempt to port many of GNU Coreutils' tools to the [Zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) shell language. __Do not use this: this is only a way of showing the power and capability of Zsh, and to have some fun doing it.__

Contributions are welcome, even if easy to implement.
